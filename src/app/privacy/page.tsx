          We may share your personal data with our affiliates and delegates. In
          certain circumstances we may be legally obliged to share your personal
          data and other financial information with respect to your interest in
          the Company with relevant regulatory authorities such as the Cayman
          Islands Monetary Authority or the Tax Information Authority. They, in
          turn, may exchange this information with foreign authorities,
          including tax authorities and other applicable regulatory authorities.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl tracking-loose">
          The Company&apos;s affiliates and delegates may process your personal
          data on the Company&apos;s behalf, including with our banks,
          accountants, auditors and lawyers which may be data controllers in
          their own right. The Company&apos;s services providers are generally
          processors acting on the instructions of the Company. Additionally, a
          service provider may use your personal data where this is necessary
          for compliance with a legal obligation to which it is directly subject
          (for example, to comply with applicable law in the area of anti-money
          laundering and counter terrorist financing or where mandated by a
          court order or regulatory sanction). The service provider, in respect
          of this specific use of personal data, acts as a data controller.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl tracking-loose">
          In exceptional circumstances, we will share your personal data with
          regulatory, prosecuting and other governmental agencies or
          departments, and parties to litigation (whether pending or threatened)
          in any country or territory.

          Sending your personal data internationally
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl tracking-loose">
          Due to the international nature of our business, your personal data
          may be transferred to jurisdictions that do not offer equivalent
          protection of personal data as under the Data Protection Legislation.
          In such cases, we will process personal data or procure that it be
          processed in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection
          Legislation, which may include having appropriate contractual
          undertakings in legal agreements with service providers who process
          personal data on our behalf.

        <h3 className="mt-3.5 font-fg text-3xl font-[600] ">
          Retention and deletion of your personal data
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl tracking-loose">
          We will keep your personal data for as long as it is required by us.
          For example, we may require it for our legitimate business purposes,
          to perform our contractual obligations, or where law or regulation
          obliges us to. We will generally retain your personal data throughout
          the lifecycle of your engagement in transactions or business with us.
          Some personal data will be retained after your relationship with us
          ends. We expect to delete your personal data (at the latest) once
          there is no longer any legal or regulatory requirement or legitimate
          business purpose for retaining your personal data.

          We will not take decisions producing legal effects concerning you, or
          otherwise significantly affecting you, based solely on automated
          processing of your personal data, unless we have considered the
          proposed processing in a particular case and concluded in writing that
          it meets the applicable requirements under the Data Protection
          Legislation.
