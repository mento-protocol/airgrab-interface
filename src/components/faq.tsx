      <span>
        The MENTO token is an ERC-20 token on the Celo Blockchain that will
        grant access to a tailored governance structure that specifically caters
        to the unique needs of the Mento Platform.

    question: "What is an airdrop, and how will it be performed?",
    answer: (

        <span>
          An airdrop is the process of distributing MENTO governance tokens to
          the existing community members as a reward for their past
          contributions to the development and usage of Mento decentralized
          stable assets or the Celo ecosystem overall.
        </span>
        <span>
          Eligible Celo addresses can claim a combined max of 5% of the overall
          total supply. Users claiming the airdrop will receive it as veMENTO
          locked for 2 years (linearly unlocking without a cliff). The duration
          of an airdrop campaign is 2 months. After the airdrop period ends,
          unclaimed amounts will go to the Mento Community Fund.

    question: "What is veMENTO?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <span>
          veMENTO (vote-escrowed MENTO) is a locked version of the MENTO token
          that allows its holders to participate in the governance process of
          the Mento Protocol. The veModel is an on-chain governance framework
          pioneered by Curve Finance and adopted by multiple protocols in the
          space since then. Its main goal is to reward people who are committed
          to the protocol long term. This is achieved by giving more voting
          power to those who lock MENTO for longer periods of time.
        </span>
        <span>
          In the case of the Mento Protocol, it is possible to lock MENTO for a
          period of one week up to two years.

          need to make sure that owners of eligible addresses are not on the AML
          sanctions list and are not residents of one of the restricted
          jurisdictions. We have partnered with Fractal ID to ensure that
          claimers fulfil these conditions. Claimers will be asked to upload
          their verification documents directly to Fractal ID.
